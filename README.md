# OOP-Ex3  
This project is about weighted directed graph with graph theory algoritms.   
In this project we implement graphs according to the json format which are in the doc folder.   
And it is also possible to exercise graphs manually.  
In this project we implement a number of algorithms which check the shortest distance from vertex to another vertex   
and also what the connected components of a particular vertex are and also on the whole graph itself,  
Ö¿And also the realization of the graph drawing.  
In addition, we compared two different languages of development (Python and Java).   
We compared Ex2 which works on graphs in java, and Ex3 in Python (development of identical graphs in different languages).  
In our comparisons we tested the algorithms in each language versus networkX (in Python).
