# OOP-Ex3  
This project is about weighted directed graph with graph theory algoritms.   
In this project we implement graphs according to the json format which are in the doc folder.   
And it is also possible to exercise graphs manually.  
In this project we implement a number of algorithms which check the shortest distance from vertex to another vertex   
and also what the connected components of a particular vertex are and also on the whole graph itself,  
Ö¿And also the realization of the graph drawing.
